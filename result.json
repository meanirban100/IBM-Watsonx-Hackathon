Let me investigate the situation further to provide you with more information. May I place you on hold for a moment?\n\n(Customer is put on hold for a few minutes)\n\nAgent: Thank you for waiting, John. I apologize for the delay. It seems that your package experienced some issues during transit, and it's currently being held at the courier's facility. I have escalated the issue to our shipping department, and they will contact the courier to expedite the delivery. Please accept our apologies for the inconvenience.\n\nCustomer: This is unacceptable, Sarah. I paid for express shipping, and I expected to receive my package on time. What are you going to do to fix this?\n\nAgent: I understand your frustration, John. We take these issues very seriously, and we will do everything we can to resolve the situation. I will personally follow up with the shipping department and the courier to ensure that your package is delivered as soon as possible. In the meantime, I can offer you a partial refund for the shipping cost as a gesture of goodwill. Would that be acceptable to you, John?\n\nCustomer: I guess that's better than nothing, Sarah. But I'm still very disappointed with the service.\n\nAgent: I apologize again for the inconvenience, John. We value your business, and we will do our best to make it right. Is there anything else I can assist you with?\n\nCustomer: No, that's all. I just hope I receive my package soon.\n\nAgent: I understand, John. I will keep you updated on the status of your package. Thank you for contacting BrownBox Customer Support, and have a good day.\n\nCustomer: Alright, thank you, Sarah.",
